:al8:...
:al9:uuughhhh, fuuuckkk.
:same:My...glasses.
:bf:bruh
:al9:I know, swearing is not necessary.
:al8:...
:al9:I guess it is too late to do anything now.
:same:The night has come.
:same:People are losing their shit already.
:bf:...
:al8:...
:al9:Can I ask you one question?
:bf:beep?
:al9:You are very good at what you are doing. 
:same:And it seems that you came here for more than just a tour.
:same:Who was the initiator of the trip? Who told you about this place?
:bf:beep boop
:al9:Your girlfriend?
:same:...
:same:I don't understand.
:bf:beep boop bop
:al8:...
:al9:Daddy Dearest you say?
:bf:...
:al9:So you *did* go here just to visit this place for fun...
:same:...with zero knowledge about it.
:same:Though I didn't expect to hear that name from you,...
:same:...I can see why you got noticed by that girl.
:same:You are a pro.
:al8:...
:al9:Usually guests of the city don't stay here for long.
:same:People who don't get it treat it like a roller coaster.
:same:You enter, have fun in this odd town,...
:same:...Chat with robot friends, see some attractions, and leave.
:same:They have no idea what is happening here when they leave.
:bf:...
:al9:I had to give you a tour, wait for you to get bored and accompany you to the exit.
:al9:But I got so mesmerised by your skills I totally forgot about the regulations.
:same:So we are stuck in this situation together.
:same:But since I am dealing with not just some tourist...
:same:...I think I can tell you the truth about this place.
:bf:...
:al9:As I said when we've just met, METRONOPOLIS is alive by pure musical enthusiasm.
:same:METRONOPOLIS has gathered in itself an unbelievable amount of music pioneers.
:same:And knowing human's nature, this enthusiasm can take different forms.
:same:Some people like one music genre, some people don't. That is normal.
:same:But sometimes, people want more than that...
:same:Something that forces city to adapt its beat to the tempo people desire.
:same:Something that is beyond the Prestissimo mark on our metronomes.
:al11:People want something HARD.
:al10:And when it happens, all public service robots have to keep the tempo stable...
:same:...So that METRONOPOLIS could stay active after the rave.
:same:In our case, to live through this friday night.
:bf:...
:al9:Daddy Dearest was not the founder of this city,..
:same:...But he was one of the people who pushed this idea forward in the right circles.
:same:...So that someone like-minded could pick it up.
:same:So you can say it all started with him.
:same:But it was in the distant past.
:same:And I don't think his daughter knows everything about it.
:bf:...
:bf:beep
:al8:...
:al9:You want to help?
:al8:...
:al9:The city doesn't close its doors during the night, I lied.
:same:Thought it would be enough for us to get going.
:same:I apologise.
:same:You can help me hold the metronome going further.
:same:You are a very skillful guy, so let's sing another song at last.
:same:The moment we finish, you are to leave this place immediately.
:same:Me and other public service robots will do the rest.
:al11:Are you ready?
:bf:beep!
:al10:Okay.
